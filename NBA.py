You've been hired as the general manager of the Knicks, and it's your job to
figure out which basketball players you want to trade for.  You only want to
trade for players that make at least 50% of the shots they've tried and have
played at least 50 games.  You have a list of all players in the league, with
their names, number of games played, average number of shots attempted (FGA)
and average number of shots made (FGM).  Create a report for yourself by
doing the following...

Download the stats-clean.txt file linked to from the course web site.

Use File --> save as ... to save in the same directory as your Python program.

Write a program that:

* reads in data from a file called stats-clean.txt, which contains a list of
  players and their statistics
    * the first line of the file is the header: NAME,POS,TEAM,GP,FGM,FGA
    * each subsequent row contains player stats
    * the stats are separated by commas
    * for example, in the following line... James Harden,SG,HOU,78,7.5,17.1:
        * Name (NAME) -> James Harden
        * Position (POS) -> SG
        * Team (TEAM) -> HOU
        * Games Played (GP) -> 78
        * Average Shots Made Per Game (FGM) -> 7.5
        * Average Shots Attempted Per Game (FGA) -> 17.1
    * HINT: ... split may come in handy here
* calculate a player's shooting percentage by dividing their shots made by
  their shots attempted (FGM/FGA)
        * USE EXCEPTION HANDLING to deal with divide by zero errors, or
          unexpected data from file
* whittle down this list to only players that:
    * made at least 50% of their shots
    * have played at least 50 games
* write out the names of these players, along with their shooting percentage
  into a new file
    * the file should be called report.csv
    * each name and shooting percentage will be on one line
    * ... with a comma separating the two
    * YOUR CALCULATIONS MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR ROUND
    * format the output in any way that you like (the example output simply
    * formats to two places)
    * it should look similar to this:
